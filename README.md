This launcher will save you from all of the troubles when installing my [Multiplayer Extension](https://github.com/NoamRothschild/infinitefusion-multiplayer), not only making the installing process faster, but also simpler.

## How to install:

[### You can reffer to this link that will guide you on the installation
or follow the instructions bellow.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSdJekd5UsY)
- Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/NoamRothschild/MultiplayerLauncher/releases) and install the latest PIF-MultiplayerLauncher.zip
- After done installing, extract & open up PIF-MultiplayerLauncher.exe
  
If you see a Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warning when opening our app, please follow these steps to proceed:
1. Click on "More info" in the warning dialog.
2. Click "Run anyway" to start the app.

This Microsoft Defender SmartScreen message appears because the app is not recognized by Microsoft's database and lacks a verified publisher, do not worry.

### What to-do
- Note: before we start, please do not close any terminals (the black windows with text) while they are going unless they finished installing (last line is 'Press any key to exit').

After you have opened the app, you can jump into the "Install Menu" and download Python & Redis (Once python is done).
Note: checkbox icons refresh on launcher opening (in order to see the changed icon, you need to close and reopen the whole launcher)
After that, click on Download Game to install the game.
- Green checkmark -> Installed successfully

If you want to play preloaded, you can then go onto the "Sprite Menu" & install both the autogenerated sprites & the custom sprites (you can run both terminals in parallel)
- Green checkmark -> Installed successfully

### I'm done installing! how do I start?

Unfortunately, you will need to do 1 more step that cannot be automated.
- Click on "Open Redis" inside the "Settings", and sign up and create a database for free (pick the closest to your location).
- After you are done, you can click on your database and then press 'connect' under endpoint in the databases list.
- Select 'Redis Client' and select 'Python'
- Copy the host, port & password (press on the eye icon to show) to your app and click on 'apply changes'
- Make sure to send your friend those same credentials (Both players need to put the same database information inside the settings menu)
- Once done, each player needs to select a player number, remember that game number for later.

## We are done!
### **All of the following steps must be repeated on each gaming session, including the last ones:**

- all you need to do right now is start up the game & the server. this may take some time on your first launch.
- Note: if the server says 'Multiplayer Server Loaded!', congrats! you didnt screw up ;)
- After the game was opened and a save was entered, go inside the game settings (in game) and set your player number
- Select the same player number you selected in the settings before and exit (if already selected you can close without doing nothing)
- You are done! just make sure to close and open both the server and the game each time you play.

- **To clarify what each player needs to do:**

| Setting | Player 1 | Player 2 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Launcher setting    | button is off (left)  | button is on (right)   |
| In-Game setting    | set to number 1 (left)   | set to number 2 (right)   |
  
# Have fun!
